# Summary Statistics
This option displays a statistical summary of numerical columns in the dataset, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, quartiles, and maximum values.

# Time Series Analysis
This option plots the time series of variables such as Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI), Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI), and Ambient Temperature (Tamb) over time.

# Correlation Analysis
This option calculates the correlation matrix between different numerical variables in the dataset and displays it as a heatmap.

# Wind Analysis
This option plots the time series of wind speed (WS) and wind direction (WD) over time.

# Temperature Analysis
This option plots the time series of module temperatures (TModA, TModB) and ambient temperature (Tamb) over time.

# Histograms
This option creates histograms for variables such as GHI, DNI, DHI, WS, and temperatures to visualize their frequency distribution.

# Box Plots
This option creates box plots for variables such as GHI, DNI, DHI, WS, and temperatures to examine their spread and presence of outliers.

# Scatter Plots
This option generates scatter plots to explore relationships between pairs of variables, such as GHI vs. Tamb, WS vs. WSgust, etc.
